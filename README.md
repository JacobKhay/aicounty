2) replication_code.R: contains the code in R that replicates the tables in the paper.

Packages to Install:

You need to install the following R packages:

- pander
- fixest
- tidyverse
You can install them in your R console using the following command:

Code snippet
install.packages(c("pander", "fixest", "tidyverse"))

Short Description of the Code:

This R code performs a regression analysis to investigate the factors associated with AI intensity at the U.S. county level.

The main steps are:

-  for Table 1: Reads county-level data from a CSV file, creates new variables and standardizes the key independent variables by converting them into
z-scores for easier comparison of coefficient magnitudes in regressions. 
Uses the fixest package to run several fixed-effects regression models (feols) to examine how demographic, innovation,
and industry structure variables relate to AI intensity , while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across years and counties 
(or state-year and county fixed effects).

-  for Table 2: Reads county-level data from a CSV file, creates the long difference of AI intensity for the period 2018-2023, 
where data for 2017 and 2018 are pooled together and similarly data for 2022 and 2023. It then creates the control variables at the first year in the sample(2017) and 
standardizes them by converting them into z-scores. Uses the fixest package to run several fixed-effects regression models (feols) to examine how demographic, 
innovation, and industry structure variables relate to the  change in AI intensity, while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across years and counties 
(or state-year and county fixed effects).
